## Getting Started
Create a server.js file containing required modules and routes. Set up a database and table to hold books. Give books as json data to a function that will place it inside of the table.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We are using nodeJS, postgresql, pg, express, fs, and heroku to deploy the app.
